# dnd [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aaronweiss74/dnd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aaronweiss74/dnd) #
An IRC bot in Rust for playing Dungeons and Dragons. Subject to serious change.

## TODO ##
Here are some of the features to be implemented soon:
* Improvements to running multiple campaigns at once with one bot. (There's some big issues.)
* More robust command parsing
* More player inquiry tools
* Battle maps!

Here are some specific tasks to do:
* Refactor functionality into structs sharing a trait, rewrite process_world accordingly.
* Implement a useful help system following previous refactor.
